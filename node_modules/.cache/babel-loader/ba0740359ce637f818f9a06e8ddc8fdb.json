Tarang is fully actuated with six thrusters providing six degrees of freedom to the vehicle. Each thruster is calibrated to map the thrust vs PWM input pulse, and these mappings are used to generate a thruster allocation matrix to distribute the thrusts generated by the PID controller to the thrusters. Since each thruster provides thrust only in a particular degree of freedom, it gives a highly decoupled system that allows the vehicle to perform aggressive manoeuvres. Furthermore, decoupled thrusters with the independent position and velocity controller provide a way to tune the position and orientation controller independently. Hence we can tune the PID systems easily.We have implemented a cascaded PID controller for better motion tracking, which considers the error in velocity as well as the error in position to calculate thrusts. It allows a faster compensation with the velocity controller providing a mechanism to prevent overshoot. Since the vehicle's weight is less, it can provide faster response, but it is also prone to large overshoots and oscillations, so parameters are tuned to provide damping and slow down the response. As a result, the motion tracking of Tarang is better than our last vehicle Anahita in terms of lower settling time, almost zero overshoot and ability to perform aggressive manoeuvres.\",\n    \"img\": \"Control Layer.png\",\n    \"imgDesc\": \"Tarang's Control Layer\"\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"title\": \"Navigation\",\n    \"content\": \"We have set a sensor fusion pipeline to combine the readings from different sensors and better assess the measurement using the Kalman Filtering algorithm.

Fast SLAM provides a factored and more efficient way to solve the SLAM problem and provides a way to solve it with a complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks observed. The navigation layer publishes a world map estimate using a 2.5-dimensional occupancy grid. The occupancy grid stores the estimates of the current state of the robot, global locations of the landmarks and previously traversed locations on the map.

Tarang is fully actuated with six thrusters providing six degrees of freedom to the vehicle. Each thruster is calibrated to map the thrust vs PWM input pulse, and these mappings are used to generate a thruster allocation matrix to distribute the thrusts generated by the PID controller to the thrusters. Since each thruster provides thrust only in a particular degree of freedom, it gives a highly decoupled system that allows the vehicle to perform aggressive manoeuvres. Furthermore, decoupled thrusters with the independent position and velocity controller provide a way to tune the position and orientation controller independently. Hence we can tune the PID systems easily.We have implemented a cascaded PID controller for better motion tracking, which considers the error in velocity as well as the error in position to calculate thrusts. It allows a faster compensation with the velocity controller providing a mechanism to prevent overshoot. Since the vehicle's weight is less, it can provide faster response, but it is also prone to large overshoots and oscillations, so parameters are tuned to provide damping and slow down the response. As a result, the motion tracking of Tarang is better than our last vehicle Anahita in terms of lower settling time, almost zero overshoot and ability to perform aggressive manoeuvres.\",\n            \"img\": \"Control Layer.png\",\n            \"imgDesc\": \"Tarang's Control Layer\"\n        },\n        {   \"id\":2,\n            \"title\": \"Navigation\",\n            \"content\": \"We have set a sensor fusion pipeline to combine the readings from different sensors and better assess the measurement using the Kalman Filtering algorithm.

This year we have added an implementation of the SLAM algorithm known as FastSLAM for navigation. Fast SLAM provides a factored and more efficient way to solve the SLAM problem and provides a way to solve it with a complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks observed. The navigation layer publishes a world map estimate using a 2.5-dimensional occupancy grid. The occupancy grid stores the estimates of the current state of the robot, global locations of the landmarks and previously traversed locations on the map. The global map helps us in planning and changing our strategy dynamically.\",\n            \"img\": \"Navigation Layer (4).png\",\n            \"imgDesc\": \"Tarang's Navigation Layer\"\n        },\n        {   \"id\":3,\n            \"title\": \"YoloV3\",\n            \"content\": \"For detecting various objects like buoys, gates during the tasks, we are using the YOLOv3 object detection algorithm in contrast to classical computer vision algorithms used in our last vehicle Anahita.
